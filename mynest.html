      Purpose of Creation/bg:
      “The Problem”:
      Roommates need an efficient way to distribute tasks and streamline communication in order to lessen conflict and save time.

      something more targeted towards roommates rather than just task apps, or just family apps: something that centers and organizes all.
      	more casual than micromanaging, for youth/non family
      simplistic app: not bogged down with features
      	shortly describe its key features
      Something that offer a new safety feature
      SLC product
      …

<div id = "nest4">

    <div class= "mynestp1" > <p> Competitive Analysis </p> </div>

    <p>
      Competitive Analysis:
      (literature review & competitor analysis)
      	•lot of roommate finding apps
      	•money apps: venmo, split wise, tricount
      	•General tasks: Roof, Tody
      	•house tasks: flatastic
      	•familychores: Our Home, cozi, homey

      Flatastic: In German even after language change, UI not good, hard to read. Has a scoring system, side tab, with notifications.

      Our Home: has some info fill out, email required, homepage is tasks to do, with people displayed across top. bottom nav. Option to repeat tasks. Also has a points/rewards system. Has option to change icons for new tasks, and for people to attach photos. Theres a points bank as well- mainly to reward kids.
      Can see self completed tasks. Also has groceries as separate task tab.
      Can see the tasks you completed-can also move back to “to-do”. Can also assign tasks
      (a little complicated)
      Can’t edit made tasks though

      nudge function is nice. People want a notepad or non task related things (reminders)
      Also the ability to hide appoints/lists
      Accessibility- option for bigger text.
      some small icons are hard to click/not as high up on the hierarchy as they should be
      Easy to add new task (all apps mostly have in same place)
      Theres option to sort tasks by type.
      I think its necessary to have some sort of chat.
      maybe have a “bulletin board” of all new feed/updates
      have a nice loading page

      Cozi: also has initial info ask. Also has option to integrate calendars (google, apple, outlook). Homepage is also tasks but in calendar. a little redundant on bottom nav (yes, bottom nav as well.). Also a family oriented app. UI not as good as Our Home
      UI is bulky

      **move tasks to bottom nav

      Information Architecture:
      	Design Iterations —> old to new


      Wireframes
      (in order of type of action)

      Low fidelity —> high fidelity (show development of each key action)(show diff designs)
